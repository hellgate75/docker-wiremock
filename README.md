## Docker Image for Wiremock™ Server

This Docker Image prepare to run a Wiremock™ Server, useful to develop contract between UI and service layers


## Mock your APIs for fast, robust and comprehensive testing

WireMock™ is a simulator for HTTP-based APIs. Some might consider it a service virtualization tool or a mock server.

It enables you to stay productive when an API you depend on doesn't exist or isn't complete. It supports testing of edge cases and failure modes that the real API won't reliably produce. And because it's fast it can reduce your build time from hours down to minutes.


### Goals

Project aims are :
* Define Wiremock™ Server resilient and lightweight docker container
* Define auto-configurable Wiremock™ Server docker container
* Define Apache™ Zookeper integration, to allow remote REST mocking configuration management
* Define mappings and static content auto-download manager for docker container
* Define a wide-usable Development Integration docker container, that is capable to interact with CI tools, Artifact repositories, and other platform components
* Define a SAFE process-ready testing, contracting and validating swiss-knife toolset

*Caution* : No warranties are extended to production or business use of this container, and we are not responsible for illegal or inappropriate use of this project outcomes or any damage on business or digital crime, derived for third-parties actions.


### Our Philosophy

`Try it. Determine business value, derived from product features. Then you consider to buy a license and/or implement a production-ready docker image, accordingly to Product Provider trading or commercial rules.`

*Assumptions* : All our docker images are continuous delivery process ready, and all of them have been tested on `Kubernetes`, `MESOS`, `Portainer.IO`, `Rancher` and `Spinnaker` delivery frameworks, before we released on Docker Hub.


### About WireMock™

Here a list of WireMock™ related pages :

* [Homepage](http://wiremock.org/)

* [Getting Started](http://wiremock.org/docs/getting-started/)


### Docker Environment

Docker container exposes following ports:

* `8080`:
Wiremock™ Server HTTP port

* `443`:
Wiremock™ Server HTTPS port


Docker container exposes following volumes:

* `/wiremock/mappings`:
Folder containing mapping files

* `/wiremock/__files`:
Folder containing static files

* `/wiremock/certificates`:
Folder containing SSL certificate files


Docker container defines following environment variables:

*Infrastructure configuration*:

* `WM_CONFIGURATION_SCRIPT_URL`: Url referring to Ubuntu bash script, defining variables and base actions, executed before Wiremock™ Server start up (default : )
* `WM_CERTIFICATE_TAR_GZ_URL`: Url referring to tar gz format file, containing SSL certificate files, installed in the system before Wiremock™ Server start up (default : )
* `WM_MAPPINGS_TAR_GZ_URL`: Url referring to tar gz format file, containing mapping files, installed in the system before Wiremock™ Server start up (default : )
* `WM_STATIC_FILES_TAR_GZ_URL`: Url referring to tar gz format file, containing static files, installed in the system before Wiremock™ Server start up (default : )

*Fine grained settings*:

* `WM_HTTP_PORT`: Set the HTTP protocol port number (default : 8080)
* `WM_HTTPS_PORT`: Set the HTTPS protocol port number (default : 443)
* `WM_USE_SSL`: [yes/no] Defines to prefer use of SSL over simple HTTP protocol (default : no)
* `VM_VERBOSE`: [yes/no] Turn on verbose logging (default : yes)
* `WM_BINDING_ADDRESS`: The IP address the WireMock server should serve from. Binds to all local network adapters if unspecified (default : "0.0.0.0")
* `VM_EXTENSIONS`: Extension class names e.g. com.mycorp.HeaderTransformer,com.mycorp.BodyTransformer. See [extending-wiremock](http://wiremock.org/docs/extending-wiremock/) (default : )
* `WM_HTTPS_KEYSTORE`: Path to a keystore file containing an SSL certificate to use with HTTPS. The keystore must have a password of “password”. This option will only work if Wiremock™ Server SSL protocol is enabled. If this option isn’t used WireMock will default to its own self-signed certificate (default : )
* `WM_HTTPS_KS_PASSWORD`: Password to the keystore, if something other than “password” (default : )
* `WM_HTTPS_TRUSTSTORE`: Path to a keystore file containing client certificates. See https and proxy-client-certs for details (default : )
* `WM_HTTPS_TS_PASSWORD`: Optional password to the trust store. Defaults to “password” if not specified (default : )
* `WM_FORCE_REQUIRE_CLIENT_CERT`: [yes/no] Force clients to authenticate with a client certificate. See [https](http://wiremock.org/docs/https/) for details (default : no)
* `WM_RECORD_MAPPING`: [yes/no] Record incoming requests as stub mappings. See [record-playback](http://wiremock.org/docs/record-playback/) and [record-playback-legacy](http://wiremock.org/docs/record-playback-legacy/)  (default : no)
* `VM_MATCH_HEADERS`: [yes/no] When in record mode, capture request headers with the keys specified. See [record-playback](http://wiremock.org/docs/record-playback/) (default : no)
* `VM_PROXY_ALL`: Proxy all requests through to another base URL e.g. "http://api.someservice.com" Typically used in conjunction with `WM_RECORD_MAPPING` on `yes` such that a session on another service can be recorded. (default : )
* `VM_PRESERVE_POST_HEADER`: When in proxy mode, it passes the Host header as it comes from the client through to the proxied service. When this option is not present, the Host header value is deducted from the proxy URL. This option is only available if the `VM_PROXY_ALL` option is specified [yes/no] (default : no)
* `VM_PROXY_VIA`: When proxying requests (either by using `VM_PROXY_ALL` or by creating stub mappings that proxy to other hosts), route via another proxy server (useful when inside a corporate network that only permits internet access via an opaque proxy). e.g. "webproxy.mycorp.com" (defaults to port 80) or "webproxy.mycorp.com:8080" (default : )
* `WM_ENABLE_BROWSER_PROXY`: [yes/no] Run as a browser proxy. See [browser-proxying](http://wiremock.org/docs/proxying/) (default : no)
* `WM_DISABLE_REQUEST_JOURNAL`: [yes/no] Disable the request journal, which records incoming requests for later verification. This allows WireMock to be run (and serve stubs) for long periods (without resetting) without exhausting the heap. The `WM_RECORD_MAPPING` option isn’t available if this one is specified (default : no)
* `WM_CONTAINER_THREADS`: [yes/no] The number of threads created for incoming requests (default : 10)
* `WM_MAX_REQUESTS_JOURNAL_ENTRIES`: Set maximum number of entries in request journal (if enabled). When this limit is reached oldest entries will be discarded (default : )
* `WM_JETTY_REQUEST_THREADS`: The number of threads Jetty uses for accepting requests (default : )
* `WM_JETTY_QUEUE_SIZE`: The Jetty queue size for accepted requests (default : )
* `WM_JETTY_HEADER_BUFFER_SIZE_KB`: The Jetty buffer size (in kilobytes) for request headers, e.g. "16384" (default : 8192)
* `WM_PRINT_ALL_NETWORK_TRAFFIC`: [yes/no] Print all raw incoming and outgoing network traffic (default : no)
* `WM_GLOBAL_RESPONSE_TEMPLATING`: [yes/no] Render all response definitions using Handlebars template (default : no)
* `WM_LOCAL_RESPONSE_TEMPLATING`: [yes/no] Enable rendering of response definitions using Handlebars templates for specific stub mappings (default : no)
